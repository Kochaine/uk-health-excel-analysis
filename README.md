Excel-based analysis of UK health metricsâ€”BMI, sleep, smoking, exercise, income &amp; alcohol trends
# UK Health Data Analysis (Excel)

A hands-on Excel project exploring UK health metrics and how lifestyle, demographics, and chronic conditions relate.

 What I did

I built these pivot tables and charts in Excel (Office 365):

1. Average BMI by smoking status
2. Average sleep hours by age group
3. Count of people with chronic conditions by exercise frequency
4. Count of smokers by gender
5. Household income by region
6. Alcohol intake (units per week) by gender and health condition
7. Alcohol units per week by number of chronic conditions

On the Dashboard sheet I added slicers for Age Group, Gender and Region so you can filter any combination of these variables.

 How to explore

1. Open uk\_health\_dataset\_expanded.xlsx
2. Look at the Raw Data sheet for the original table
3. Check each Pivot sheet for underlying summaries
4. View the Charts sheet for formatted visuals
5. Use the Dashboard sheet and its slicers to interactively explore relationships

 Method

* Cleaned up category labels and handled missing values
* Created one pivot per question, including calculated fields for averages
* Made bar, column and line charts, then organized everything into a dashboard
* Interpreted patterns (for example: higher BMI in daily smokers or sleep trends by age)
